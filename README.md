# Number Guessing Game 🎯

A simple Python console game where you try to guess a random number between **1 and 100** before you run out of lives.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The program randomly picks a number from **1 to 100**
- You start with **5 lives**
- You type a number guess each round
- The game tells you:
  - **"up"** if your guess is too low
  - **"down"** if your guess is too high
- Each wrong guess costs **1 life**
- The game ends when:
  - you guess correctly, or
  - you lose all your lives
